# Spellcheck console app

A very simple MVC spellcheck app. Currently it's a console app.
As user input it takes a directory containing one or multiple files (later on also webpages from a URL) and a dictionary containing the typos to look for.

## Sample

The app\samples\dictionary folder contains a dictionary.txt file as an example.
TODO: The app\samples\report\report_sample.txt file contains a sample report.

## Usage

If the dictionary file and the file path to store the report aren't provided, the default are used, respectively:
`app\samples\dictionary\dictionary.txt`
`app\sample\dictionary\reports\report_dd_mm_yyyy_hh_mm_ss.txt`
